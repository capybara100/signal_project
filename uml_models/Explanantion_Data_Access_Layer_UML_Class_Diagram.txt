The reasoning that goes behind the Data Acess Layer class diagram was to make it logical and straightforward. For the classes
we have dataListener, DataParser, DataSourceAdapter, FileDataListener, TCPDataListener and WebSocketDataListener.
It is valuable to have to DataListener classes to be able to receive data from different sources such as files which the FileDataListener uses, WebSocket connection or over a TCP connection.
The DataListener is dependent on those classes that is why there is arrows pointing it. This system is all about flexibility that is why there is so many
DateListener classes. The DataParser is dependent to the DataListener class to be able to parse raw data into the system in a way that is easy to understand and process.
The DataSourceAdapter class is depedent to the DataParser class to be able communicate between the system and other data sources. 
It is also important to appreciate the methods within the DataListener classes we have classes to listen to cnnection and to close them, parse data and send data.
For attributes I shown them through the methods of DataListener and DataSourceAdapter which are connected which a boolean (it can only have two possibilities be 
connected or not), databaseConnections as a Connection and DataStorage as a DataStorage  to store specific details of the data.
