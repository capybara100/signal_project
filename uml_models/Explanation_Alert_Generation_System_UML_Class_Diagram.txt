My rationale for the UML class diagram was to keep it simple and concise.
There is five classes which are AlertGenerator, Alert, AlertManager, Patient and Threshold.
It seemed wise to add Patient class and threshold as they are important class to inform the alert.
The Alert class is dependant on the AlertGenerator without it it wouldn't exist. Just like how the 
the AlertManager is reliant on the Alert class that is why they have both composition relationships.
Also, an Alert class cannot exist without having a Patient class that is why I added a composition relationship to the classes.
The Threshold lets the Patient class know which are values a condition should be to be considered worrisome.
There can be many alerts made that is why the Alert class has a multiplicity of 0 and to many. What is may be taken away from my diagram is
that there is exactly only one patient to each alert created. I had created simply one Threshold class by grouping all vital signs to use this class 
instead of having too many classes as to make things more concise and reusable. For the Patient class it is important to have the attributes of id and medicalConditions 
as they help informing the medical staff on to which patient to attend to and what issue they are having.
