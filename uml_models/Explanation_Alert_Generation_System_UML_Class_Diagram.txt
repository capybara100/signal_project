My rationale for the UML class diagram was to keep it simple and concise.
There is five classes which are AlertGenerator, Alert, AlertManager, Patient and Threshold.
It seemed wise to add Patient class and threshold as they are important class to inform the alert.
The Alert class is dependant on the AlertGenerator without it it wouldn't exist. Just like how the 
the Alertmanager is reliant on the Alert class that is why they have both composition relationships.
The Threshold lets the Patient class know which are values a condintion should be to be considered worrisome.
There can be many alerts made that is why the Alert class has a multiplicity of 0 and to many.
