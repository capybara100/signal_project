The rationale for this Alert Generation System Sequence Diagram was to show a clear sequence diagram of the Alert Generation System lifecycle.
I made the choice of having the actor be the medical staff that are ready to take action when needed. In the diagram we have the first message being the alertGenerator 
checking condition of the patient for continuing trend when a threshold is exceeded. There is an alternative box for the two cases of the condition being a continuing trend or not.
As you can imagine if it is a continuing trend then you get a return message that states such. Then we need the AlertGenerator to create an alert and send alert to the medical staff.
The else condition is of course if it is not a contuining trend then that is all that needs to be done.
The alert is resolved. We need the alert lifeline to start later than the other because we first need to check conditions before an alert can be made.
Resolving the alert message is the last message made to help the patient's condition. AlertGenerator and datStorage lifelines both lifelines statr at the same point as they 
both contribute to the first message that was made.
