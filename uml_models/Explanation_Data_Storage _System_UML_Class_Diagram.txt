The rationale for this Data Storage system class diagram is to have an uncomplicated model of how the system works.
There are three method shown in this diagram which includes PatientData, DataStorage and DataRetriver.
PatientData and DataStorage show an aggregated relationship as they are not strongly depedent on each other.
The PatientData class would still exist if the DataStorage did not remain. The DataRetriver class is dependant
on the DataStorage class as that is where it gets it's data. The purpose of DataRetriver is to retrieve data that
is exactly why it has such method to extract data of a patient. The DataStorage has an attribute for storage which has a private visibility
as it wouldn't make sense to be accessed by any other class or sub-class. It also has methods to store data, retrieve data and delete unnecessary data.
The PatientData class on the other hand has patientId, metrics and timestamp which all are as private visibility and are essential
to the class. It is importatnt to also include method to get and set these attributes for example getPateintId(), getMetrics() and getTimestamp().
As you may notice I tried to correctly implement a diagram that encapsulates all the essentials.
